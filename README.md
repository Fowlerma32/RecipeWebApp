# RecipeWebApp
This project will be to create a recipe web application, where the user lists ingredients and types of food, and the application returns relevant recipes.

This app will include a login to allow users to create an account which they can use to save preferred ingredients, styles of food, and recipe information. 

I intend to use the PERN stack to create this project.
