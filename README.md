# RecipeWebApp
This project will be to create a recipe web application, where the user lists ingredients and types of food, and the application returns relevant recipes.

The app will include a login to allow users to create an account which they can use to save preferred ingredients, styles of food, and recipe information. 

Spoonacular and Edamam are APIs which I can use to obtain the recipe information. I also intend to use the PERN stack to create this project and Render to deploy it.
